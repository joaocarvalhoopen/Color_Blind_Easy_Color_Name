# Color Blind Easy Color Name
A simple project to assist color blind persons.

## Description
A simple project that given a color code in hexadecimal String, <br>
```
$ color_blind_easy_color_name d3c2a5
  Slightly Dark Orangish White

or 

$ cargo run --release -- D3C2A5
  Slightly Dark Orangish White
```
gives back a description of the color has a string. The description is perceptually good for a color blind person. The majority of color blind persons don't see only black and white color, or gray shades, but normally they are more sensible to one color then the others. <br>
<br>
The reason why I did this small program is: <br>
In the world population 8% of men and 0.5% of women are color blind. This is roughly 300 million men and 19 million women. There should exist free programs to assist them. <br>
Also there are many different methods to do a color picker depending on the operating system you are (Windows, Linux or Mac) and depending, for example in Linux if you have a X or Wayland windows system. <br>
Many of the possible solution work with a shell script and you can simply pipe it to this program and redirect the output.This is a fast executing program. <br>
<br>
The color text descriptions where extracted and reformated from a section from the free accessible file [https://www.hikarun.com/e/color-fr.xml](https://www.hikarun.com/e/color-fr.xml) There you can find a free windows program for color blind persons. See my formatted file for details.
